# 📬 Telegram-Inspired Terminal Messenger

A command-line-based chat application that mimics core features of Telegram, written in **Java** using full **OOP principles**.

> This project was built as a university assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course (my first project in JAVA) and demonstrates concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, composition, exception handling, and more.

## 📦 Features

- User registration & login
- Private chats, groups, and channels
- Roles: Owner, Admin, NormalUser, Viewer
- Text & multimedia messages
- Editable/deletable messages (with permission logic)
- Instagram-like profile & posts system
- User plans: Basic, Silver, Gold (post limits)
- Fully terminal-based UI with menu navigation
- Custom exceptions and clean input handling
- Modular code organized using managers & models
